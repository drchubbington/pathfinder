# pathfinder
A pathfinder for tile-based worlds. Placeholder grid values are: road (open pathway), forest (wall), field (optional wall), and market (objective).
The tester starts by printing the initial map layout. It then finds the shortest path from (8, 2) to the nearest market (in this example, it is the only market). Finally, it prints out the positions it would be at each step of the path. The first number in a point refers to the row and the second refers to the column. To find where the given point is on the map, start at the top left of the map and count from 0 up.
